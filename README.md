# Azure-Verified-Modules-Grept

This repository stores the [grept](https://github.com/Azure/grept) configuration for Azure Verified Modules.
We have a [cron job](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Verified-Modules-Grept/actions/workflows/grept-cronjob.yml) that is used to ensure compliance at scale.

We are working to roll this out in a gradual manner.
